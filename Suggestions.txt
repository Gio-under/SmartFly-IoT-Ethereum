SMART CONTACT BEST PRACTICES:
1-Memory organization: alignment
2-Reduce number of SSTORE operations maximizing the 256 bit write operation (put write in same memory area closer in code)
3-Efficient data structures: maps
4-Avoid calling functions in loop (reduce memory allocation)
5-Reduce use of persistent memory areas (storage, logs - to write persistent data)
7-Uncheck arithmetics (overflows-underflow are automatically check in recent pragmas, disable them to reduce costs if needed)

IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS:
1- Update to latest pragma.
2- Find a better way to encode and decode input header (this can save a ton of gas and memory).
3- Make the provers persistently store the MMR and update form specific point (now only stored in ram and sync with chain data at start)
